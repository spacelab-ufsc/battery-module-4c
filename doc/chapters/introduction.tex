\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

The {Battery Module 4C}\nomenclature{\textbf{BATC4}}{\textit{Battery Module 4C.}} is a separate board from the EPS2\nomenclature{\textbf{EPS}}{\textit{Energy Power System.}} \cite{eps2} in order to accommodate 4 lithium-ion cells. Besides the cells, the board has connectors for interfacing signals and power lines with the EPS2 module, 2 power resistors to operate as heaters to maintain the cells temperature during eclipse periods, and 4 temperature sensors. The batteries used are the \textbf{ICR18650-30B} lithium-ion cells, which are connected in series and parallel to supply the required voltage and current. Each cell is fixed with \textbf{18650} metal holders and between the pairs there is the power resistor attached with a thermal element in the middle. A mechanical mount is placed over the batteries and screwed to the board, providing better stress resistance. Also, there are PC104 through hole pads present on the board for a connector that could be used for making mechanical integration with the EPS, or with future improvements a interface for power, data or control signals.

The board is a direct improvement from the first battery board used in the FloripaSat-1 mission \cite{battery-board-1}. All the project, source and documentation files are available freely on a GitHub repository \cite{bat4c} under its repectives licenses.
